## Getting Started

Please follow the general instructions for all exercises mentioned above.

In this exercise, we will use RGB Led Common Cathode, with I is the common pin. We will use the PWM pulse to change the brightness of the LED.

### Prerequisites

1 RGB LED

1 resistor

7 Jumper Wires

1 Breadboard

**GPIO Connection Table:**

|Raspberry Pi 3|Peripherals|
|:--|:--|
|BCM2|B pin| 
BCM3|R pin
BCM4|G pin
PWM0|I pin 

### Operational principles

By changing the width of PWM pulse , we change the luminance of the LED.
